Another project from my OneDrive archive. This is from 2005/6/7 so I can't really remember how complete it is, knowing me not 100%! :D

It's a good example of a lot of things though;
- it uses OpenGL for rendering, 
- it has it's own scripting language which uses a bytecode format for fast execution, 
- it has a 3D engine and all the associated maths etc.
- it has a simulation engine that could easily be modified to a game loop
- it has convolution filters for image processing (sharpen, emboss, blur etc.)
- it has a utility class that will fetch URLs using WinHTTP
